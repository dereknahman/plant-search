# plant-search

Welcome to my side-project! It's a plant search engine built using React and the wonderful [Trefle API](https://trefle.io/).

Clone the repo and run the project locally by running the following commands in your terminal:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

I'll write more detailed, beginner-friendly instructions here when it's prudent to do so. As it stands - trust me - you won't get very much out of playing with the app on your local machine just yet.

I am working on making it look decent now that the API request is working. This includes: creating a list item component to display the results, creating a detail screen to display when the user clicks on a given plant.

In the future I plan to include the following features:

♿️ Accessibility  
📖 Pagination  
🛣 Routing  
📱 Mobile support  

...and plenty more besides.

Thanks for stopping by! 👋🏻
